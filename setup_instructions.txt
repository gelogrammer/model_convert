   - Open the file: direct_create_recordings.sql
   - Select all (Ctrl+A) and copy (Ctrl+C)

2. Go to Supabase SQL Editor:
   - URL: https://pztstrmccavxrgccvmjq.supabase.co/project/sql
   - Login if necessary

3. Create a new SQL query:
   - Click the "+ New Query" button
   - Paste the SQL content (Ctrl+V) into the editor

   - Click the "Run" button
   - Wait for the query to complete (it should show success notices)

If you still encounter issues:
- Check the browser console for specific error messages (F12 in most browsers)
- Verify your internet connection is stable

The SQL creates:
- A recordings table with required columns and permissions
- A storage bucket for the audio files
- All necessary security policies for anonymous and authenticated users
